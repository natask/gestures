I wanted an application that will allow me to fluidly express my intent through the touch-pad and touchscreen. 
I felt shackled by one-shot gestures from [[https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures][libinput-gestures]] but from it I found the utility of eight-directional gestures.
I felt [[https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma][fusuma]] was lacking Although it was more fluid.
I really missed keeping my fingers moving across the touch-pad to switch applications. 
I wanted five finger gestures. 
I wanted usable gestures for my touchscreen.

So I wrote this.

- python dependencies ::
  subprocess, pathlib, shlex, threading, queue, time, os, sys, math
- *nix dependencies ::
  cat, grep
- dependencies ::
  stdbuf, evtest
  - evtest ::
    will maybe replaced by evemu-record in the future.
  - daemonize ::
    using =& disown= should work as well but this is a sure way to detach and run this on a global scale.
- default dependencies (if running default configuration) :: 
  - evemu ::
    need evemu-do (alternative to xdotool that I wrote) in $PATH.

- [[https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures][libinput-gestures]] ::
  - what I used to use. 
  - Works well, just that the gestures are one-shot, meaning that the command attached to a gesture is executed only once per full swipe. 
  - depends on libinput. 
- [[https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma][fusuma]] ::
  - Although it doesn't have one-shot limitation, it didn't support commands to run when the gesture begins and ends. This is useful for use-cases like switching applications which require alt-down to be pressed.
  - didn't support eight-directional gestures.
